```

## NYC aggregate in-out flows

Next let's examine the net inflow-outlow aggregate dataset by USPS.

```{r}
#grand totals per covid vs. not
net_flows_usps_zips_NYC %>% 
  group_by(covid_flag) %>% 
  summarise(total_out = sum(total_from_zip, na.rm = TRUE), 
            total_in = sum(total_to_zip, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_net_gain = sum(total_net_gain, na.rm = TRUE))

```

Let's look at that by borough.

```{r}
#compare by BOROUGH
net_flows_usps_zips_NYC %>% 
  group_by(borough, covid_flag) %>% 
  summarise(total_out = sum(total_from_zip, na.rm = TRUE), 
            total_in = sum(total_to_zip, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_net_gain = sum(total_net_gain, na.rm = TRUE)) 

```

Let's look at it through the lens of time and money.

### Net flows by month

We can see the enormous exodus that happened in March 2020 and the subsequent months, with a rebound as the year progressed.

The city was still losing more people on a net basis, but the gradually less than before.

```{r}
net_flows_NYC_monthly <- net_flows_usps_zips_NYC %>% 
  group_by(datemonth, covid_flag) %>% 
  summarise(total_net_gain = sum(total_net_gain, na.rm = TRUE))

head(net_flows_NYC_monthly)

```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fig <- plot_ly(data= net_flows_NYC_monthly, x = ~datemonth, y = ~total_net_gain, name = 'Moves', 
               type = 'scatter', mode = 'bars',
               line = list(color = 'darkred', width = 3))

fig
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fig <- fig %>% layout(title = "Net number of household moves from all NYC zip codes",
         xaxis = list(title = "Months"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Net gain/loss in Moves"))

fig
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fig <- fig %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)

fig

```

### Net flows by month and zip

What does that look like for each zip code individually throughout the city?

```{r}

net_flows_monthly_byzip <- net_flows_usps_zips_NYC %>% 
  group_by(datemonth, zipcode) %>% 
  summarise(total_net_gain = sum(total_net_gain, na.rm = TRUE))

# net_flows_monthly_byzip

#create plotly chart object
all_zips_plotlychart <- net_flows_monthly_byzip %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~datemonth, y = ~total_net_gain) %>%
  add_lines(
    name = "NYC Zips", 
    line = list(width = 1.33), 
    alpha = 0.2, 
    hoverinfo = "none"
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

all_zips_plotlychart <- all_zips_plotlychart %>% 
  layout(title = "Net gain/loss of NYC moves by zip code",
         xaxis = list(title = "Month"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Net gain/loss of households")) %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)

all_zips_plotlychart 

```

That's a little hard to decipher on its own.\
Let's look at the where the ***highest-income zips in the city*** are themselves in that hairball.

```{r}
### join IRS data back in to pull together wealth measures from AGI
irs_zips_agi_grouped <- readRDS("data/irs_zips_agi_grouped.rds")

netflows_by_zip_withagi <- net_flows_usps_zips_NYC %>% 
  group_by(zipcode) %>% 
  summarise(total_net_gain = sum(total_net_gain, na.rm = TRUE))

netflows_by_zip_withagi <- left_join(netflows_by_zip_withagi, irs_zips_agi_grouped, by = "zipcode") 

nyc_agi_top5zips <- netflows_by_zip_withagi %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_agi)) %>% 
  head(8) %>% 
  pull(zipcode)

nyc_agi_botton5zips <- netflows_by_zip_withagi %>% 
  arrange(avg_agi) %>% 
  head(8) %>% 
  pull(zipcode)
```


```{r}
# # highlight one zip
# all_zips_plotlychart %>%
#   filter(zipcode == "10011") %>%
#   add_lines(name = "10011")


# create function to handle multiple zips fed to plotly object at once
zip_layer <- function(plot_obj, zip_name) {
  plot_obj %>%
    filter(zipcode == zip_name) %>%
    add_lines(name = zip_name)
}

# sort(nyc_agi_top5zips)

#highest income zips
all_zips_plotlychart %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10005") %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10007") %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10282") %>% 
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10022") %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10069") %>% # <- top five ends here
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10013") %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10018") %>% 
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10021") 
```

Now let's look at the ***lowest-income zip codes in the city***, many clustered in the Bronx, to see how they've fared.

In this case, it appears the poorest zips barely changed at all during the Covid era.

```{r}

# sort(nyc_agi_botton5zips)

#lowest income zips
all_zips_plotlychart %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10452") %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10453") %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10454") %>% 
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10456") %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10457") %>% # <- top five ends here
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10455") %>%
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "10474") %>% 
  add_fun(zip_layer, zip_name = "11355")



```

### Covid vs. previous period - compare change in total net per zip

```{r}
#covid vs not breakdowns

netflows_by_zip_andcovid_withagi <- net_flows_usps_zips_NYC %>% 
  group_by(zipcode, borough, covid_flag) %>% 
  summarise(total_net_gain = sum(total_net_gain, na.rm = TRUE))

netflows_by_zip_andcovid_withagi <- left_join(netflows_by_zip_andcovid_withagi, irs_zips_agi_grouped, by = "zipcode") 

#reshape
net_change_byzip_withagi <- netflows_by_zip_andcovid_withagi %>% 
  select(zipcode, borough, avg_agi, covid_flag, total_net_gain) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = covid_flag, names_prefix = "netgainloss_", values_from = total_net_gain)

#calculate diff
net_change_byzip_withagi <- net_change_byzip_withagi %>% 
  mutate(
    netgainloss_diff = netgainloss_covid - netgainloss_noncovid
  ) 

```

Plot of change in net flow - Covid vs. Non-Covid
```{r}

                             color = 'rgba(255, 182, 193, .9)',
                             line = list(color = 'rgba(152, 0, 0, .8)',
