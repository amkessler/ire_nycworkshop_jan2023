# IRE NYC Workshop - Jan. 2023

This repository contains materials for the R training sessions at [IRE NYC Workshop](https://www.ire.org/ire-new-york-workshop-2023/) in Jan 2023, held at the CUNY journalism school.

It's designed for those who no prior experience with R to get an introduction to the fundamental concepts of R and data analysis within the tidyverse ecosystem, and then from there dive into some introductions to mapping and chart-making within R.

If you are using your personal computer, you can either clone this repo as a new project, or run the following line in the R console:

`usethis::use_course("https://github.com/amkessler/ire_nycworkshop_jan2023/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)`

If you're using [RStudio Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (now called [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)), you'll want to create a "new project from git" option and then clone this repo that way.

In addition to the materials we'll cover here, these are some additional resources you may find helpful in exploring your R journey further:
